title: 'Bug Bounty Program'
description: 'Report security issues in any NovaShield product and earn rewards in $NVAI or SOL.'

## Overview

The NovaShield Bug Bounty Program rewards security researchers and community members who help us keep **all NovaShield products** safe, including:

- **iOS wallet** (live)
- **Web & browser experiences** (including multisig and dashboard – coming soon)
- **Android wallet** (coming soon)
- Related backend services and APIs that power these experiences

If you discover a vulnerability or suspicious behavior, please **do not** disclose it publicly. Instead, contact us directly so we can investigate and ship a fix.

## How to Report a Bug

You can report bugs and security issues through either of the following channels:

- **Telegram**: Reach out to our team via Telegram (use the in-app link or the official Telegram listed on the NovaShield website).
- **Email**: Send details to [hi@nshield.org](mailto:hi@nshield.org).

When reporting, please include:

- **Clear description** of the issue
- **Steps to reproduce** (if possible)
- **Expected vs actual behavior**
- **Screenshots, videos, or logs** if they help demonstrate the issue
- **Environment details** (iOS/Android version, browser, app version, network, etc.)
- **Your preferred contact** (for follow-ups and reward coordination)

## Rewards

Eligible reports may receive rewards paid in **$NVAI** or **SOL**, depending on:

- **Severity** of the vulnerability
- **Impact** on user funds, privacy, or platform integrity
- **Quality and clarity** of the report
- **Exploitability** and likelihood of real-world abuse

Rewards are granted at NovaShield’s discretion. We may group related reports or adjust rewards based on overlap with previously reported issues.

## Scope

In general, the following are **in scope**:

- **NovaShield iOS wallet app** (core functionality, transaction flows, key management, settings)
- **Upcoming NovaShield web, multisig, and Android wallet** surfaces
- **Security checks and warnings** related to transactions, tokens, dApps, and URLs
- **Backend services and APIs** that directly support NovaShield wallet and security features
- **Account and data handling** that could impact user privacy or security

The following are generally **out of scope**:

- Issues that require a **jailbroken/rooted** device or non-standard OS modifications
- **Social engineering**, phishing, or attacks that target individual users instead of NovaShield
- Third-party services or infrastructure not operated by NovaShield
- UI/UX bugs that do not affect security or privacy

If you’re unsure whether something is in scope, feel free to contact us anyway—we’ll let you know.

## Responsible Disclosure

By participating in this program, you agree to:

- Avoid accessing, modifying, or deleting other users’ data
- Not disrupt or degrade the service for other users
- Give NovaShield a **reasonable amount of time** to investigate and remediate the issue before any public disclosure

We reserve the right to change, pause, or end the bug bounty program at any time. Thank you for helping keep NovaShield and its users safe.
