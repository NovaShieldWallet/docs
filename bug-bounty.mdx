title: 'Security & Bug Bounty'
description: 'Scoped bug bounty program for Nova multisig security vulnerabilities.'
---

Nova welcomes responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities that directly impact **Nova multisig security**. This program is intentionally narrow in scope and is designed to focus only on issues that can affect multisig approvals and transaction safety. It applies only to the Nova iOS multisig client and the Nova-managed on-chain multisig program at `novatSa4s7wJBHPoCWzyK45Z2N6ky3uYiBEQtw3FjJb`, not to web or other non-iOS frontends.

## Scope

### In Scope

The following areas are in scope **only when they directly impact Nova multisig security**:

| Category                                          | Description / Examples                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| iOS multisig approval logic                      | Flaws in how the iOS app enforces or presents multisig approvals that could cause an approval to be recorded or interpreted incorrectly.                          |
| Multisig transaction creation, signing, execution| Issues in how transactions are built, signed, or executed for multisig that could lead to incorrect or unintended on-chain actions.                               |
| Threshold enforcement                            | Any issue that allows bypassing, weakening, or miscalculating the required multisig signature threshold.                                                          |
| Signer authorization and validation              | Bugs that cause an unauthorized signer to be treated as authorized, or that incorrectly validate signer identity or permissions.                                  |
| Replay or approval reuse attacks                 | Reuse of prior approvals, signatures, or intents to execute new or modified transactions without fresh, explicit multisig approval.                               |
| State desynchronization between signers          | Inconsistencies between different signers’ views of multisig state that can be exploited to cause incorrect assumptions about approvals or transaction status.    |
| Client → on-chain multisig message integrity     | Any manipulation of data between the iOS client and the on-chain multisig program that can alter transaction contents, recipients, or amounts without detection.  |
| On-chain multisig program behavior (Nova usage)  | Vulnerabilities in the Nova-managed on-chain multisig program at `novatSa4s7wJBHPoCWzyK45Z2N6ky3uYiBEQtw3FjJb` that can lead to unauthorized transactions or incorrect execution semantics.   |

If a bug allows bypassing approvals, miscounting approvals, or executing a transaction incorrectly in a multisig context, it is in scope.

### Out of Scope

The following categories are explicitly **out of scope** for this program and will not be considered for rewards:

| Category                                  | Description / Examples                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| UI / UX issues                            | Visual glitches, layout issues, copy changes, non-security usability problems.                                           |
| Feature requests                          | Suggestions for new features, design changes, or product improvements.                                                  |
| Performance issues                        | Latency, non-security-related performance problems, or efficiency concerns without security impact.                     |
| Crash-only bugs                           | Crashes, errors, or panics that do not result in a security impact on multisig approvals or transactions.              |
| Social engineering                        | Attacks against Nova staff, users, or partners via phishing, fraud, or impersonation.                                   |
| Phishing or fake apps                     | Malicious third-party apps, wallets, or websites impersonating Nova.                                                    |
| Other clients and frontends (non-iOS)     | Web dashboards, browser extensions, desktop clients, or third-party apps, even if they interact with the same multisig program address.                         |
| Third-party RPCs, SDKs, or Solana issues  | Vulnerabilities in underlying Solana network, validators, RPC providers, third-party SDKs, or other external services.  |
| iOS system vulnerabilities                | Vulnerabilities in iOS, Apple services, or hardware outside of Nova’s apps and infrastructure.                          |
| Testnet-only behavior                     | Issues that occur only on testnet, devnet, or non-production environments.                                              |
| Physical device compromise                | Attacks requiring theft, loss, or direct physical control of a user’s device.                                           |
| Known or already-public vulnerabilities   | Issues that have already been publicly disclosed or are already known and accepted by Nova.                             |
| Anything not affecting multisig security  | Any issue that does not measurably affect Nova multisig approval, threshold enforcement, or transaction correctness.    |

> **Before You Submit**
>
> - Only issues that directly affect **Nova multisig security** are accepted.
> - UI bugs, non-security crashes, and feature requests will be ignored.
> - Reports must include clear reproduction steps and a proof of concept (PoC).
> - Do not publicly disclose any details of the vulnerability before Nova has confirmed and resolved it.

## Submission Process

All vulnerability reports **must be submitted through the official form**. We do not accept reports via email, social media, GitHub issues, or any other channel.

**Bug Submission Form**  
[https://tally.so/r/dWEX0A](https://tally.so/r/dWEX0A)

When submitting a report, include at minimum:

- Clear, step-by-step **reproduction instructions**.
- A **proof of concept (PoC)** demonstrating the impact.
- **App version** and build, if available.
- **Device and OS version** (for example: iPhone model and iOS version).
- Any relevant **wallet addresses**, transaction IDs, or multisig identifiers.

Submissions that lack sufficient detail to reproduce and understand impact may be closed without further review.

## Rewards

Nova may offer monetary rewards for valid reports that:

- Demonstrate a clear, exploitable impact on **Nova multisig security**.
- Fall within the **In Scope** categories defined above.
- Are reported privately and responsibly through the official form.

Rewards are:

- **Severity-based** and determined at Nova’s sole discretion.
- **Paid only after verification and remediation** of the issue.
- **Not paid for duplicate reports** of an issue that has already been reported by another researcher.
- Discussed and arranged individually with the researcher after validation (no fixed, pre-published payout amounts).

Submitting a report does **not** guarantee a reward.

## Disclosure Rules

By participating in this program, you agree to:

- **No public disclosure** of the vulnerability or related details until Nova confirms that a fix has been deployed or explicitly authorizes disclosure.
- **No exploitation beyond what is necessary for proof of concept**:
  - Do not attempt to move, withdraw, or otherwise access funds that do not belong to you.
  - Do not intentionally disrupt service availability or degrade the experience for other users.
- **No access to third-party data or accounts** beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- **No spam or automated submissions**, including bulk scanning without a clear, well-documented finding.

Violations of these rules may disqualify you from receiving any reward and may result in additional actions if harm is caused.

## Legal Safe Harbor

Nova is committed to supporting good-faith security research on our multisig systems.

If you:

- Make a good-faith effort to comply with this policy,
- Limit testing to the scope defined above,
- Avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, or service degradation, and
- Report findings promptly and privately through the official form,

then Nova will not initiate legal action against you for your security research activities conducted under this policy.

This safe harbor does **not** apply to actions that are unlawful, that cause harm beyond what is necessary to demonstrate a vulnerability, or that fall outside the scope and rules defined in this document.

> This program is intentionally scoped. Reports unrelated to multisig security will be closed without response.
