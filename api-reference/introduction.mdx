## NovaShield APIs

**Security** - Detect rug pulls, honeypots, and phishing sites before your users get scammed.

Both available as APIs and integrated into the **[Nova iOS Wallet](/quickstart)**.

## Core Features

**Token Security** - AI-powered analysis catches scams before they happen  
**Honeypot Detection** - Verify tokens are actually tradeable  
**Privacy Cash** - Untraceable SOL transfers (1% + 0.006 SOL fee)  
**Phishing Protection** - Block typosquatting and fake sites  
**Transaction Simulation** - Preview what transactions do before signing
