## Perpetual Futures

Trade crypto with leverage using perpetual futures contracts. Available directly in Nova Wallet.

## Key Terms

Tap the **info icons** throughout the perpetuals trading interface to learn about:

### Leverage
Multiply your position size (e.g., 10x leverage = 10x gains or losses)

### Funding Rate
Periodic payments between long and short positions to keep price anchored to spot

### Liquidation Price
Price at which your position is automatically closed to prevent further losses
