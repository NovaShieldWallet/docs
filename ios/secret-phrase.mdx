## Your Secret Recovery Phrase

Your secret phrase (also called seed phrase) is the master key to your wallet. Anyone with this phrase has complete access to your funds.

## When You'll See It

Nova shows your secret phrase when:
- Creating a new wallet
- Viewing backup in settings
- Recovering your wallet

## Critical Security Rules

### DO

- Write it down on paper
- Store it in a secure physical location (safe, safety deposit box)
- Keep multiple backup copies in different locations
- Verify you wrote it correctly before depositing funds

### NEVER

- Take a screenshot or photo
- Store it digitally (cloud, email, notes apps)
- Share it with anyone (including support teams)
- Enter it on any website or app you don't completely trust
- Store it on a device connected to the internet

## Common Scams

**WARNING: No one legitimate will EVER ask for your secret phrase**

Scammers pretending to be:
- Support teams
- Wallet developers
- Exchange representatives
- "Security verifiers"

## If Your Phrase Is Compromised

1. **Immediately** create a new wallet with a new phrase
2. Transfer all assets to the new wallet
3. Abandon the compromised wallet
4. Never use that phrase again

## Nova Vault Protection

For maximum security, enable **Nova Vault** with multi-signature protection. Even if someone gets your secret phrase, they can't move funds without the second approval.

Your secret phrase = your money. Protect it like gold.
