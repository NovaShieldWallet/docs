## What Is the TRON MultiSig Scam?

A common scam where attackers trick users into setting up a TRON account with multisig permissions, giving the scammer partial control over your funds.

## How the Scam Works

1. Scammer contacts you with "investment opportunity"
2. They ask you to create a TRON account
3. They add themselves as a multisig signer
4. They drain your funds when you deposit

## Nova's Protection

When Nova detects a TRON account with suspicious multisig settings, you'll see:

### TRON Account Blocked Banner

**Warning**: This account has multisig permissions that could allow someone else to access your funds.

### What to Do

If you see this banner:

1. **DO NOT** deposit any funds
2. **DO NOT** trust anyone asking you to use this account
3. Create a new TRON account without multisig
4. Report the scammer

## Red Flags

**WARNING:** Someone asks you to create a specific TRON account  
**WARNING:** "Investment opportunity" requires using their account setup  
**WARNING:** They guide you through adding multisig signers  
**WARNING:** Promises of guaranteed returns  

## Safe TRON Usage

**Create your own accounts**  
**Never share account permissions**  
**Only add multisig signers you completely trust**  
**Understand multisig before enabling it**  

**Remember**: No legitimate service will ask you to set up multisig with them.
