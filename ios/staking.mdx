## Staking in Nova Wallet

Stake your SOL to earn rewards while supporting the Solana network.

## Getting Started

Tap the **info icon** on the staking screen for detailed instructions and current APY rates.

## How Staking Works

1. Choose a validator
2. Delegate your SOL
3. Earn rewards (paid each epoch)
4. Unstake anytime (2-3 day unbonding)

## Choosing a Validator

Consider:
- **Commission rate**: Lower = more rewards for you
- **Uptime**: Higher = more consistent rewards
- **Stake amount**: Avoid over-concentrated validators

## Rewards

- Paid automatically each epoch (~2 days)
- Compound automatically if you keep staking
- Current APY varies (typically 5-8%)

## Unstaking

- Start unstake process in the app
- 2-3 day unbonding period
- Funds become available after deactivation
