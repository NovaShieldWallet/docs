## What Is Slippage?

Slippage is the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual executed price. This happens when the market price changes between when you submit and when the trade executes.

## Setting Slippage Tolerance

Tap the **info icon** on the swap screen to adjust your slippage tolerance.

## Recommended Settings

- **Low liquidity tokens**: 5-10% slippage
- **High liquidity tokens**: 0.5-1% slippage
- **Stablecoins**: 0.1-0.5% slippage

## Why It Matters

- **Too low**: Your transaction may fail if price moves
- **Too high**: You may get a worse price than expected

**WARNING:** High slippage on liquid tokens can indicate price manipulation or MEV attacks.
