Each provider maintains their own country allowlist and blocklist, which is checked before allowing any transaction to proceed.

### 3. Per-Asset Restrictions
Some cryptocurrencies have additional country restrictions beyond the provider level, based on regulatory concerns or licensing requirements.

### 4. Real-Time Sanctions Screening
All providers perform real-time sanctions screening during:
- Account creation
- Each transaction
- Periodic re-verification
