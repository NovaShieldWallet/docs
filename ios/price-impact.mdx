## What Is Price Impact?

Price impact is how much your trade moves the market price. Large trades in small liquidity pools have higher price impact.

## Viewing Price Impact

Tap the **info icon** on the swap screen to see the estimated price impact of your trade.

## Impact Levels

- **<0.1%**: Negligible impact
- **0.1-1%**: Low impact
- **1-3%**: Medium impact
- **3-5%**: High impact
- **>5%**: Very high impact

## Why It Matters

High price impact means:
- You're getting a worse price
- The pool has low liquidity
- You're buying/selling a large amount relative to pool size

**Recommendation**: Split large trades into smaller chunks or use limit orders to reduce price impact.
