## Nova Safari Extension

Connect to Solana dApps directly from Safari without leaving your browser. No more clunky in-app browsers.

## Key Features

### AI-Powered Phishing Detection
Every website you connect to is automatically scanned for:
- Typosquatting attempts
- Known phishing domains
- Suspicious URLs

### Seamless dApp Connection
- One-click wallet connection
- Transaction approval in Safari
- No app switching required

### Security First
- Real-time threat analysis
- Automatic blocking of dangerous sites
- Clear risk warnings before connecting

## How It Works

1. Visit any Solana dApp in Safari
2. Extension detects wallet connect requests
3. Site is scanned for phishing indicators
4. Approve or reject connection based on safety

## Why Safari Extension?

**Traditional in-app browsers:**
- Clunky and limited  
- Poor user experience  
- Can't use Safari features  

**Nova Safari Extension:**
- Native Safari experience  
- Full browser functionality  
- Built-in security scanning  
- Faster and smoother  

## Enabling the Extension

1. Open Nova Wallet
2. Go to Settings → Safari Extension
3. Follow the setup instructions
4. Grant permissions in Safari settings

The extension runs entirely locally and never sends your browsing data to external servers.
